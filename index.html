<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>This is the home page for my -side, fun, weekend etc.- projects. More than 15 years I am building things on the side or brew my ideas in notepads. Starting with 2024 I decided to make it in public. So any project I am starting and developing will be under this site's menu. I will also try to write some posts regarding the development process and stuff I had to tackle down the road i.e. learnings.</p>
<p>Also these articles will be saved in my <a href="https://archive.canburaktumer.com">archive</a> which is created by my own <a href="https://github.com/CanburakTumer/tiniest_static_website">tiniest Static Website Generator</a> as also this website has been.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas or comments feel free to create an <a href="https://github.com/CanburakTumer/CanburakTumer/issues/new/choose">issue in my personal repository</a>  </p>
